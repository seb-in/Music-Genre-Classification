## Project Description
Using a dataset comprised of songs of two music genres (Hip-Hop and Rock) which are based entirely on track information derived from Echonest (now part of Spotify) a classifier is trained in order to distinguish between this two genres. 

First data exploration and visualization is carried out using ```pandas``` and ```seaborn``` packages to find obvious trends and patterns in the data.

Next predictions are made using ```scikit-learn``` package to predict whether it is possible to correctly classify a song's genre based on its features(danceability, energy, acousticness, tempo, etc).

Some common algorithms such as PCA, logistic regression, decision trees will then be implemented.

This project deals with Supervised Machine Learning, which involves data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and machine learning using the scikit-learn package.
